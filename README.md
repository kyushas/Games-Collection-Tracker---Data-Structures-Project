# Games-Collection-Tracker---Data-Structures-Project
Simple videogames colleciton tracker that I made for my Data Structure &amp; Algorithms course in university using Python. 

Since this was an university project I don't really plan to go back to it to make changes or anything. The main focus of it was to practice the implementation of different data structures. 

>
> ## Features
- Store and retrieve video games using unique keys
- Search them by title, genre, platform and release year range
- Binary Search Tree to sort games by platform
- Load games from .csv files
- Remove games from your collection
- Text-based menu interface
- Example data set available in the repository

> ## Data Structures
- Dictionary - for fast lookups by unique key
- List - for search results and full listing
- Binary Search Tree - for ordering games by platform
  **Note:** I used the website https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-in-python/ as a reference for the bst.py code.

> ## CSV Format Example
To load games from a file you should use a `.csv` with the following format:
`key,title,genre,year,publisher,platform
001,Hollow Knight,Metroidvania,2018,Team Cherry,Steam
002,Death Stranding,Strand,2019,Kojima Productions,PlayStation 5
003,Portal 2,Puzzle,2011,VALVE,PC`
